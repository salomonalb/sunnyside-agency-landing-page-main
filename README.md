# Sunnyside Agency Landing Page
This Project is a responsive landing page based on the design given by [frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).

It's made with HTML, SCSS and TypeScript.

To make the page responsive I used CSS Grid, Flexbox and media Queries.   

To make the sizes more fluid I used the CSS min() function along with vw (viewport width) units.

I also took advantage of SCSS specific features like Variables, Nested Selectors, Nested Media Queries and the Parent Selector '&'. 

This allowed me to Organize my styles with the [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/).

Typescript was used in a small script for the navigation, making sure the variables were of HTMLElement type.

For the animations I used [WickedCSS animations library](https://kristofferandreasen.github.io/wickedCSS/).

The build tool I use to compile my .scss and .ts files is [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

This repository was created using the GitHub CLI.

The final result is deployed to Netlify.
